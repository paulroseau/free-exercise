# Free Exercise

This is a tiny exercise trying to put in practice the use of Free monad to
implement a json RESTful CRUD API.

Basic integration tests are provided in the `test.sh` script. To execute them run the
following commands :
```
# In terminal 1
sbt run
```
and
```
# In terminal 2
./test.sh
```
